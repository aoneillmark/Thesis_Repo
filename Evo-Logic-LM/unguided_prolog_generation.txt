- Given the insurance contract below, translate the document into valid Prolog rules so that I can run a Prolog query on the code regarding whether or not some claim is covered under the policy and receive the correct answer to the question.
- Please fully define all predicates and DO NOT define any facts, only rules that can be used to answer queries on this insurance contract.
- Assume that all dates/times in any query to this code (apart from the claimantâ€™s age) will be given RELATIVE to the effective date of the policy (i.e. there will never be a need to calculate the time elapsed between two dates). Take dates RELATIVE TO the effective date into account when writing this encoding.
- Assume that the agreement has been signed and the premium has been paid (on time). There is no need to encode rules or facts for these conditions.
- Return only Prolog code in your reply. No explanation is necessary.
- Ensure that:
1. The legal text is appropriately translated into correct Prolog rules.
2. The output does not redefine, misuse, or conflict with any built-in Prolog predicates.
3. If dynamic predicates are necessary, they are declared and managed correctly.
4. All predicates used in the generated Prolog code, including those referenced in the query, are fully defined and error-free to prevent issues like 'procedure does not exist.'
5. Logical relationships, conditions, and dependencies in the text are faithfully represented in the Prolog rules to ensure accurate query results.
