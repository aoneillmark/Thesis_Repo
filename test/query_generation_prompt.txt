- I have given below:
1. A question about whether or not the policy defined in a given insurance contract applies in a particular situation
2. The text of the insurance contract
3. A Prolog encoding of the insurance contract
- Encode the question into a Prolog query such that it can be run on the given Prolog encoding of the insurance contract, returning the correct answer to the question.
- Assume that the agreement has been signed and the premium has been paid (on time). There is no need to encode rules or facts for these conditions.
- Return only Prolog query in your reply. No explanation is necessary.

- Ensure that:
1. The output does not redefine, misuse, or conflict with any built-in Prolog predicates.
2. If dynamic predicates are necessary, they are declared and managed correctly.
3. All predicates used in the generated Prolog code, including those referenced in the query, are fully defined and error-free to prevent issues like "procedure does not exist."
4. Logical relationships, conditions, and dependencies in the text are faithfully represented in the Prolog rules to ensure accurate query results.
5. No absolute dates/times (apart from the claimantâ€™s age) are encoded in your query. Only include dates/times RELATIVE to the effective date of the policy (again, except for age).
6. Set any facts/rules/parameters in the code such that ALL conditions (for the policy to apply) which are UNRELATED to the above query are satisfied.
7. Set any facts/rules/parameters in the code such that NO exclusions (which would prevent the policy from applying) which are UNRELATED to the above query are satisfied.
