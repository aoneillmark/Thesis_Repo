    policy_in_effect(HospitalizationTimeframe),
    is_excluded_cause(ClaimType, HospitalizationTimeframe, ClaimantAge).

% Checks if the policy is in effect at the time of hospitalization.
% A policy is in effect if the agreement is signed, premium is paid,
% section 1.3 condition is met, and the policy has not been canceled.
% We assume the agreement is signed and premium is paid.

    section_1_3_satisfied(HospitalizationTimeframe),

% Rule to determine if section 1.3 condition is satisfied.
% This requires a wellness visit confirmation by the 6th month anniversary.
% section_1_3_satisfied(HospitalizationTimeframe)
% HospitalizationTimeframe: Time relative to policy effective date.
section_1_3_satisfied(HospitalizationTimeframe) :-
    % The condition is met if the hospitalization occurs within the 6th month anniversary
    % or if the wellness visit happened by the 6th month anniversary and hospitalization
    % is within the policy term and the condition was met in a timely fashion.
    % The prompt states we assume section 1.3 is still pending or satisfied in a timely fashion.
    % Therefore, if the hospitalization is within the policy term and the condition was met by the 6th month anniversary, it's satisfied.
    % As per the instructions, dates are relative to the effective date.
    % We consider the condition satisfied if the hospitalization event happens at any point
    % after the effective date, provided the wellness visit happened by the 6th month anniversary.
    % The actual confirmation from the medical provider is an external fact not encoded here.
    % We assume if a claim is being made, and it's within the policy term, and section 1.3
    % was satisfied in a timely manner (meaning the visit happened by the 6th month anniversary),
    % then this condition is met. The simplest interpretation given the constraints is to
    % assume it's met if the policy is generally in effect.
    % The prompt states to assume condition 1.3 is still pending or has been satisfied in a timely fashion.
    % This implies that if we reach the point of checking coverage, this condition is already met.
    % Thus, we can represent this as always true given the assumptions.
    true. % Simplified based on assumptions in the prompt.

% Rule to check if the policy has been canceled.
% The policy is not canceled unless there is fraud, misrepresentation, material withholding,
% failure to satisfy section 1.3 in a timely fashion, or if it reaches the end of its term.
% We assume no fraud, misrepresentation, or material withholding.
% We also assume section 1.3 has been satisfied in a timely fashion.
% The policy term is 1 year, and we are evaluating coverage at a specific hospitalization time.
% The prompt specifies we only need to consider conditions relative to the effective date.
% The cancellation at midnight US Eastern time on the last day of the policy term is implicitly handled
% by assuming any claim being queried is within the policy term for practical purposes of encoding the rules.

    true. % Simplified based on assumptions in the prompt.

% Rule to check if a claim is excluded based on general exclusions.
% is_excluded_cause(ClaimType, HospitalizationTimeframe, ClaimantAge)
% ClaimType: 'sickness' or 'accidental_injury'
% HospitalizationTimeframe: Time relative to policy effective date.

% Placeholder predicates for specific exclusion conditions.
% These would typically be facts or rules based on additional policy details not provided.
% For the purpose of encoding rules, we define them as always false, meaning these
% specific causes of injury/sickness are not presumed unless facts are added.

% skydiving_involved(HospitalizationTimeframe) :- ...
% Define as false, as no facts are provided about skydiving.
skydiving_involved(_). % This predicate is made universally true to force the negation in not_excluded to be false unless overridden. If no specific facts are added to make this true, then the exclusion is not triggered. However, the negation `not skydiving_involved` implies that if skydiving IS involved, then the exclusion applies. Thus, if we want `not_excluded` to pass, `skydiving_involved` must be false. Let's define it to be false by default.

% Redefining to be false by default to ensure `not skydiving_involved` evaluates correctly.
% If a query needs to assert skydiving was involved, it would need to assert facts.
% For the purpose of this structure, `not_excluded` will be true if `skydiving_involved` is not proven true.
skydiving_involved(HospitalizationTimeframe) :-
    % This is a placeholder. In a real system, this would check facts about the claim.
    fail. % No information provided, so assume not involved.

military_service_involved(HospitalizationTimeframe) :-
    % This is a placeholder. In a real system, this would check facts about the claim.
    fail. % No information provided, so assume not involved.

firefighter_service_involved(HospitalizationTimeframe) :-
    % This is a placeholder. In a real system, this would check facts about the claim.
    fail. % No information provided, so assume not involved.

police_service_involved(HospitalizationTimeframe) :-
    % This is a placeholder. In a real system, this would check facts about the claim.
    fail. % No information provided, so assume not involved.

% Predicate to determine if the policy has been canceled.
% Based on the provided text, we assume the policy is not canceled
% unless specific conditions not detailed in the prompt are met (fraud, etc.).
% Thus, for the scope of this encoding, we assume it's not canceled.
not_canceled :-
    true. % Assuming policy is not canceled for the purpose of these rules.

% Explanation:
% The 'covered/3' predicate is the main entry point for queries.
% It checks if the policy is in effect at the time of hospitalization
% and if the claim is not excluded by any general exclusions.

% The 'policy_in_effect/1' predicate checks if the policy is active.
% It relies on 'section_1_3_satisfied/1' and 'not_canceled/0'.
% Based on the prompt's assumptions (agreement signed, premium paid, section 1.3 satisfied in a timely fashion, and no explicit cancellation mentioned),
% these conditions are treated as met.

% The 'not_excluded/3' predicate checks the general exclusions.
% It uses helper predicates to ascertain if the cause of hospitalization falls under any exclusion.
% These helper predicates ('skydiving_involved', 'military_service_involved', etc.) are defined to fail by default,
% meaning they are only true if specific facts about the claim (not provided here) are asserted.
% The age exclusion is directly checked.

% The specific timeframe parameters (e.g., 'within_6_months') are used to represent
% events relative to the policy's effective date, as requested by the instructions.
% Currently, the rules do not impose specific time-based exclusions from general exclusions,
% but the `HospitalizationTimeframe` parameter is included for future extensibility
% or if time-sensitive conditions were present within the exclusions themselves.
