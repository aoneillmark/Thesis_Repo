% Predicate to determine if a policy is in effect.
% A policy is in effect if it's signed, premium is paid,
% the wellness visit condition is met, and the policy has not been canceled.
% (Note: The problem statement assumes the agreement is signed and premium is paid).
policy_in_effect(EffectiveDate) :-
    wellness_visit_condition_met(EffectiveDate),
    \+ policy_canceled(EffectiveDate).

% Predicate to check if the wellness visit condition is met.
% The condition is met if a wellness visit with a qualified medical provider
% occurred no later than the 6th month anniversary of the effective date.
wellness_visit_condition_met(EffectiveDate) :-
    % This predicate is true if the condition is met.
    % In a real system, this might involve dynamic facts about the visit.
    % For this problem, we'll assume it's met unless a cancellation condition related to it is triggered.
    true.

% Predicate to determine if the policy has been canceled.
% The policy is canceled due to fraud/misrepresentation, failure to satisfy
% the wellness visit condition in a timely fashion, or at the end of the policy term.
policy_canceled(EffectiveDate) :-
    % Cancellation due to fraud or misrepresentation.
    % (This would typically be a dynamic fact asserted based on external information).
    % For this exercise, we assume no fraud/misrepresentation unless explicitly stated otherwise.
    % If there were a fact like 'fraud_reported(PolicyID).', this rule would be:
    % policy_canceled(EffectiveDate) :- fraud_reported(_).
    fail, % Placeholder for fraud/misrepresentation, assuming none by default.

    % Cancellation due to failure to satisfy wellness visit condition in a timely fashion.
    % The condition is to supply confirmation by the 7th month anniversary of a visit by the 6th month anniversary.
    % Failure to satisfy it in a timely fashion means the condition is NOT met.
    \+ wellness_visit_condition_met(EffectiveDate),

    % Cancellation at the end of the policy term (1 year from EffectiveDate).
    % This is a temporal condition. We are given dates relative to EffectiveDate.
    % The problem statement implies we can query based on these relative times.
    % If the current relative time is after the end of the policy term, it's canceled.
    % The policy term is 1 year (12 months) from EffectiveDate.
    (current_relative_time(Time) , Time > 12).


% Predicate to determine if a claim is covered under the policy.
% A claim is covered if the policy is in effect at the time of hospitalization,
% and the event causing the sickness or accidental injury is not excluded.
claim_covered(EffectiveDate, HospitalizationDate, ClaimantAge) :-
    policy_in_effect(EffectiveDate),
    % The hospitalization must occur while the policy is in effect.
    % This implies HospitalizationDate is within the policy term and after effective date.
    % Since dates are relative, we can check if the hospitalization is within the policy duration (e.g., <= 12 months from EffectiveDate).
    % For simplicity, and given the focus on rules, we assume HospitalizationDate is valid if policy_in_effect is true.
    % More granular checking would involve knowing the policy term end relative to EffectiveDate.

    % Check that the event causing sickness/injury is not excluded.
    event_not_excluded(HospitalizationDate, ClaimantAge).

% Predicate to check if the event causing sickness or accidental injury is not excluded.
% Exclusions are based on specific activities or the claimant's age.
event_not_excluded(HospitalizationDate, ClaimantAge) :-
    % No exclusion due to skydiving.
    % (This would typically be determined by the nature of the event leading to hospitalization)
    % If event_type(Event, skydiving), then this would fail.
    % Assuming event is NOT skydiving if this rule is to pass.
    true,

    % No exclusion due to service in the military.
    % (This would typically be determined by the claimant's status)
    % If claimant_status(ClaimantID, military_service), then this would fail.
    % Assuming claimant is NOT in military service if this rule is to pass.
    true,

    % No exclusion due to service as a fire fighter.
    % (This would typically be determined by the claimant's status)
    % If claimant_status(ClaimantID, firefighter_service), then this would fail.
    % Assuming claimant is NOT a firefighter if this rule is to pass.
    true,

    % No exclusion due to service in the police.
    % (This would typically be determined by the claimant's status)
    % If claimant_status(ClaimantID, police_service), then this would fail.
    % Assuming claimant is NOT in police service if this rule is to pass.
    true,

    % Exclusion if age at hospitalization is 80 or greater.
    % This condition means the claim IS covered if age is LESS THAN 80.
    ClaimantAge < 80.

% Helper predicate for relative time (e.g., months from effective date).
% This predicate would need to be populated with the actual current date relative to the effective date in a query.
% For example, current_relative_time(3) could mean 3 months after the effective date.
% We define it to allow for queries to specify the current relative time.
% In a real system, this would be dynamically asserted or passed as a parameter.
% For the purpose of defining rules, we assume this can be queried.
current_relative_time(TimeInMonths) :-
    % This is a placeholder. In a query, you would provide a specific time, e.g.,
    % ?- current_relative_time(T).
    % Or to test a scenario:
    % ?- (current_relative_time(3), claim_covered(policy_start, hospitalization_date, 70)).
    % For rule definition, we acknowledge its existence as a parameter or query.
    % We can't define a fact for it here as per instructions.
    true.

% Example of how a query might look:
% ?- claim_covered('policy_effective_date', 'hospitalization_date_relative_to_policy', ClaimantAge).
% Example: Is a claim covered for a 70-year-old hospitalized 3 months after policy effective date?
% ?- claim_covered('policy_start', 3, 70).
% Note: 'policy_start' and 'hospitalization_date_relative_to_policy' are placeholders for specific date identifiers.
% ClaimantAge is an integer representing age at hospitalization.
% The actual date values would be passed as arguments representing months relative to the effective date.
% For instance, if effective date is Jan 1, 2023, and hospitalization is on Feb 15, 2023,
% the relative date argument would be 1 (or 2 if we are being very precise about month boundaries).
% For this encoding, we assume integer representations of months relative to the effective date.
