% Rule: policy_in_effect/1
% Description: This rule defines the conditions under which the policy is considered to be in effect.
% It checks if the agreement is signed (assumed true), premium is paid (assumed true),
% the wellness visit condition is met, and the policy has not been cancelled.
policy_in_effect(PolicyEffectiveDate) :-
    % Assumed true as per instructions: agreement_signed(PolicyEffectiveDate).
    % Assumed true as per instructions: premium_paid(PolicyEffectiveDate).
    wellness_visit_condition_met(PolicyEffectiveDate),
    policy_in_effect(PolicyEffectiveDate).

% Rule: wellness_visit_condition_met/1
% Description: This rule checks if the wellness visit condition is met.
% The condition requires a written confirmation of a wellness visit within the 6th month anniversary
% of the policy's effective date.
wellness_visit_condition_met(PolicyEffectiveDate) :-
    % The confirmation must be provided no later than the 7th month anniversary.
    % The visit itself must occur no later than the 6th month anniversary.
    % This is represented by checking if a wellness visit occurred at or before the 6th month.
    wellness_visit_occurred(PolicyEffectiveDate, 6).

% Rule: wellness_visit_occurred/2
% Description: This is a placeholder rule to check if a wellness visit occurred by a certain month anniversary.
% In a real system, this would likely query a database or a fact.
% For the purpose of this exercise, it is a rule that can be satisfied.
% For example, a query like 'wellness_visit_occurred(policy_start_date, 6).' would return true if the visit happened.
% We assume that if the condition is being checked, the event happened within the allowed timeframe.
% This rule is satisfied if the date of the wellness visit is within the specified anniversary month.
% The second argument represents the maximum month anniversary (inclusive).
wellness_visit_occurred(PolicyEffectiveDate, MaxMonthAnniversary) :-
    % Placeholder for actual check of wellness visit date.
    % We assume here that the wellness visit occurred if this rule is queried as part of a valid claim.
    % The actual date of the wellness visit is not provided in the contract text for programmatic checking,
    % so we treat it as met if the policy is in effect and other conditions are valid.
    true.

% Rule: policy_not_cancelled/1
% Description: This rule checks if the policy has not been cancelled.
% A policy is considered not cancelled if it hasn't been cancelled due to fraud,
% misrepresentation, material withholding of information, failure to meet the wellness visit condition,
% or reaching the end of its term.
policy_in_effect(PolicyEffectiveDate) :-
    not(cancelled_due_to_fraud_or_misrepresentation(PolicyEffectiveDate)),
    not(wellness_visit_condition_met(PolicyEffectiveDate)),
    not(policy_in_effect(PolicyEffectiveDate)).

% Rule: cancelled_due_to_fraud_or_misrepresentation/1
% Description: This rule asserts that the policy is cancelled if there was fraud, misrepresentation,
% or material withholding of information.
% This is a condition that would be determined externally, so we can represent it as a potentially true condition.
cancelled_due_to_fraud_or_misrepresentation(PolicyEffectiveDate) :-
    % This predicate would be true if fraud, misrepresentation, or material withholding occurred.
    % For the purpose of demonstrating rule translation, we assume this is not the case unless specified otherwise in a query context.
    fail. % Assume not cancelled by fraud/misrepresentation unless explicitly asserted.

% Rule: cancelled_due_to_wellness_visit_failure/1
% Description: This rule asserts that the policy is cancelled if the wellness visit condition was not satisfied in a timely fashion.
% This condition is met if wellness_visit_condition_met/1 returns false.
wellness_visit_condition_met(PolicyEffectiveDate) :-
    not(wellness_visit_condition_met(PolicyEffectiveDate)).

% Rule: cancelled_due_to_policy_term_end/1
% Description: This rule asserts that the policy is cancelled at the end of its term.
% The term is one year from the effective date. This rule is true if the current date is beyond the policy term.
% For simplicity in this relative date system, we assume the policy is still in effect if we are checking coverage.
% This rule would be more complex if absolute dates were involved.
policy_in_effect(PolicyEffectiveDate) :-
    % The policy term is one year from the effective date.
    % If we are querying coverage for an event, it implies the policy is still within its term,
    % unless explicitly stated otherwise.
    % In this model, we assume the policy is not expired if we are checking for a claim within its intended period.
    fail. % Assume not cancelled due to term end unless explicitly asserted.

% Rule: claim_covered/2
% Description: This is the main rule to determine if a claim is covered.
% It checks if the policy is in effect for the hospitalization and if the hospitalization
% falls under any of the general exclusions.
is_claim_covered(PolicyEffectiveDate, HospitalizationDate) :-
    policy_in_effect(PolicyEffectiveDate),
    not(is_claim_covered(PolicyEffectiveDate, HospitalizationDate)).

% Rule: exclusion_applies/2
% Description: This rule checks if any of the general exclusions apply to the hospitalization.
% An exclusion applies if the hospitalization arises out of skydiving, military service,
% firefighter service, police service, or if the claimant's age is 80 or over.
is_claim_covered(PolicyEffectiveDate, HospitalizationDate) :-
    % Section 2.1.1: Skydiving
    is_claim_covered(HospitalizationDate, skydiving),
    !. % If skydiving is the cause, no need to check further exclusions.
is_claim_covered(PolicyEffectiveDate, HospitalizationDate) :-
    % Section 2.1.2: Service in the military
    is_claim_covered(HospitalizationDate, military_service),
    !.
is_claim_covered(PolicyEffectiveDate, HospitalizationDate) :-
    % Section 2.1.3: Service as a fire fighter
    is_claim_covered(HospitalizationDate, fire_fighter_service),
    !.
is_claim_covered(PolicyEffectiveDate, HospitalizationDate) :-
    % Section 2.1.4: Service in the police
    is_claim_covered(HospitalizationDate, police_service),
    !.
is_claim_covered(PolicyEffectiveDate, HospitalizationDate) :-
    % Section 2.1.5: Age is 80 or greater at the time of hospitalization
    is_claim_covered(HospitalizationDate),
    !.

% Rule: hospitalization_due_to_activity/2
% Description: This is a placeholder rule to check if the hospitalization was due to a specific activity.
% This would be populated with facts about the circumstances of the hospitalization in a real system.
% For the purpose of this exercise, it is a rule that can be satisfied if the claim details indicate the activity.
% The first argument is the hospitalization date (relative to policy effective date).
% The second argument is the activity.
is_claim_covered(HospitalizationDate, Activity) :-
    % This predicate would be true if the hospitalization event was caused by the specified Activity.
    % Example: is_claim_covered(2 months, skydiving).
    % We assume this is false unless the claim details confirm it.
    fail.

% Rule: age_at_hospitalization_is_80_or_over/1
% Description: This rule checks if the claimant's age at the time of hospitalization is 80 years or older.
% The claimant's age would need to be provided at query time.
% The argument is the hospitalization date (relative to policy effective date).
is_claim_covered(HospitalizationDate) :-
    % This predicate would be true if the claimant's age at HospitalizationDate >= 80.
    % The age itself is not explicitly provided in the contract, but is a condition.
    % This implies that age needs to be an input to the query, not derived from the contract rules.
    % To make this rule usable in a query, it implies 'ClaimantAge' would be a variable in the query.
    % e.g. query: is_claim_covered(HospitalizationDate, ClaimantAge), ClaimantAge >= 80.
    % For this translation, we assume that if this rule is called, the age check will be performed externally.
    true. % Placeholder for age check condition.

% Dynamic predicate declaration (if needed for external facts like actual events).
% For this translation, no dynamic predicates are strictly necessary as we are translating the contract's logic rules.
% If we were to assert specific claim details (like hospitalization cause or claimant age), dynamic predicates would be useful.
% :- dynamic hospitalization_cause/2.
% :- dynamic claimant_age_at_hospitalization/2.

% Example of how a query might look, assuming some external facts or query variables:
%
% To check if a claim is covered for a hospitalization that occurred 2 months after the policy effective date:
% ?- is_claim_covered(policy_start_date, 2 months).
%
% To check if a claim is covered and the hospitalization was due to skydiving:
% ?- is_claim_covered(policy_start_date, 2 months), is_claim_covered(2 months, skydiving).
%
% To check if a claim is covered for someone aged 85 at hospitalization (2 months after policy start):
% ?- is_claim_covered(policy_start_date, 2 months), is_claim_covered(2 months, 85).
% (Note: age_at_hospitalization_is_80_or_over would need to be adapted to accept age as an input if not using a dynamic fact).
% A more direct query using a variable for age:
% ?- is_claim_covered(policy_start_date, HospitalizationDuration), Age = 85, Age >= 80, HospitalizationDuration = 2 months.
% The rule `age_at_hospitalization_is_80_or_over` is designed to be satisfied if the age condition is met.
% The actual age check `ClaimantAge >= 80` would be part of the query or a separate mechanism.
% Here, we've made `age_at_hospitalization_is_80_or_over/1` a rule that can be true, and the age check
% is implied to be handled outside or within the query context.
% For instance, a more complete query might look like:
% ?- is_claim_covered(PolicyEffectiveDate, HospitalizationDate), ClaimantAge = 85, AgeAtHospitalizationIs80OrOver(HospitalizationDate, ClaimantAge).
% However, `age_at_hospitalization_is_80_or_over/1` is defined as a predicate that needs to be true,
% and the check `ClaimantAge >= 80` is a separate condition in the query.
% Let's adjust `age_at_hospitalization_is_80_or_over` to reflect this more directly:

% Rule: age_at_hospitalization_is_80_or_over/2
% Description: This rule checks if the claimant's age at the time of hospitalization is 80 years or older.
% The first argument is the hospitalization date (relative to policy effective date).
% The second argument is the claimant's age at that time.
is_claim_covered(HospitalizationDate, ClaimantAge) :-
    ClaimantAge >= 80.

% Redefining claim_covered to use the more specific age rule:
% Rule: claim_covered/3
% Description: This is the main rule to determine if a claim is covered.
% It checks if the policy is in effect for the hospitalization, the hospitalization
% does not fall under any of the general exclusions, and the claimant's age is under 80.
is_claim_covered(PolicyEffectiveDate, HospitalizationDate, ClaimantAge) :-
    policy_in_effect(PolicyEffectiveDate),
    not(is_claim_covered(HospitalizationDate)), % Exclusion check excluding age
    ClaimantAge < 80. % Explicitly check age here as it's a query parameter

% Rule: exclusion_applies_without_age/1
% Description: This rule checks if any of the general exclusions apply to the hospitalization, EXCLUDING the age exclusion.
is_claim_covered(HospitalizationDate) :-
    % Section 2.1.1: Skydiving
    is_claim_covered(HospitalizationDate, skydiving),
    !.
is_claim_covered(HospitalizationDate) :-
    % Section 2.1.2: Service in the military
    is_claim_covered(HospitalizationDate, military_service),
    !.
is_claim_covered(HospitalizationDate) :-
    % Section 2.1.3: Service as a fire fighter
    is_claim_covered(HospitalizationDate, fire_fighter_service),
    !.
is_claim_covered(HospitalizationDate) :-
    % Section 2.1.4: Service in the police
    is_claim_covered(HospitalizationDate, police_service),
    !.

% Note on Section 3.2.1 (Arbitration) and 3.2.1 (Recover before 60 days):
% These are procedural conditions for filing a claim and are not directly about whether a claim is covered IF filed.
% They typically involve external actions like timely arbitration or proof of claim submission,
% which are beyond the scope of determining coverage based on policy terms and exclusions themselves.
% For the purpose of this translation, we focus on the coverage determination logic.

% Note on Section 3.3.1 (Laws of New York) and 3.4.1 (US Currency):
% These are governing laws and currency requirements, not conditions that affect coverage eligibility directly in terms of events.

% Note on Section 3.5.1 (Premium): Assumed paid as per instructions.
% Note on Section 3.6.1 (Policy Term): Assumed the policy is within its one-year term if we are querying coverage.
