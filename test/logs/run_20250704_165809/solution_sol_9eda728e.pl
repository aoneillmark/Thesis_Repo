% Predicate to determine if the policy is in effect at the time of hospitalization.
% The policy is in effect if:
% 1. The agreement is signed. (Assumed true for queries)
% 2. The applicable premium has been paid. (Assumed true for queries)
% 3. The condition in Section 1.3 (wellness visit) is still pending or has been satisfied in a timely fashion.
% 4. The policy has not been canceled.
policy_in_effect(TimeOfHospitalization) :-
    wellness_visit_satisfied(TimeOfHospitalization),
    policy_in_effect(TimeOfHospitalization).

% Rule to check if the wellness visit condition has been satisfied.
% The wellness visit must occur no later than the 6th month anniversary of the effective date.
% 'TimeOfHospitalization' is a term representing a point in time relative to the policy's effective date.
wellness_visit_satisfied(TimeOfHospitalization) :-
    % This rule is a placeholder. In a real system, this would likely involve
    % checking against a stored fact about the wellness visit date.
    % For the purpose of this contract translation, we assume it's satisfied if
    % a claim is being made and it hasn't been explicitly invalidated.
    % A more concrete implementation would require a fact base for the wellness visit date.
    true. % Assuming satisfied for the scope of this exercise.

% Rule to determine if the policy has been canceled.
% The policy is canceled if there is fraud, misrepresentation, material withholding of information,
% or if the wellness visit condition (Section 1.3) has not been satisfied in a timely fashion,
% or if the policy term has ended.
policy_in_effect(TimeOfHospitalization) :-
    \+ (fraud_or_misrepresentation),
    \+ (wellness_visit_not_satisfied_timely(TimeOfHospitalization)),
    \+ (policy_in_effect(TimeOfHospitalization)).

% Rule to check for fraud or misrepresentation.
% This is a placeholder. In a real system, this would involve checking against
% documented instances of fraud or misrepresentation.
fraud_or_misrepresentation :-
    fail. % Assuming no fraud or misrepresentation for the scope of this exercise.

% Rule to check if the wellness visit was not satisfied in a timely fashion.
% This means the wellness visit did not occur no later than the 6th month anniversary.
wellness_visit_not_satisfied_timely(TimeOfHospitalization) :-
    fail. % This is implied by wellness_visit_satisfied being true. If wellness_visit_satisfied
          % is false, this condition would be true, but the policy would already be
          % considered not in effect. The contract implies "satisfied in a timely fashion"
          % means within the 6th month anniversary. If it's later than that, it's not satisfied timely.

% Rule to check if the policy term has ended.
% The policy term is one year from the effective date.
% 'TimeOfHospitalization' is a point in time relative to the effective date.
policy_in_effect(TimeOfHospitalization) :-
    TimeOfHospitalization > 12. % 12 months is one year.

% Rule to determine if a claim for hospitalization is covered.
% A claim is covered if the policy is in effect at the time of hospitalization
% AND the cause of hospitalization is not excluded.
is_claim_covered(TimeOfHospitalization, ClaimantAge, CauseOfHospitalization) :-
    policy_in_effect(TimeOfHospitalization),
    is_claim_covered(TimeOfHospitalization, ClaimantAge, CauseOfHospitalization).

% Rule to check if the cause of hospitalization is not excluded.
% Exclusions apply if the cause is skydiving, military service, fire fighter service,
% police service, or if the claimant is 80 years or older at hospitalization.
is_claim_covered(_TimeOfHospitalization, ClaimantAge, CauseOfHospitalization) :-
    \+ (is_claim_covered(_TimeOfHospitalization, ClaimantAge, CauseOfHospitalization)).

% Rule to define excluded causes for a claim.
% Exclusion 2.1.1: Skydiving
is_claim_covered(_TimeOfHospitalization, _ClaimantAge, skydiving).
% Exclusion 2.1.2: Service in the military
is_claim_covered(_TimeOfHospitalization, _ClaimantAge, military_service).
% Exclusion 2.1.3: Service as a fire fighter
is_claim_covered(_TimeOfHospitalization, _ClaimantAge, firefighter_service).
% Exclusion 2.1.4: Service in the police
is_claim_covered(_TimeOfHospitalization, _ClaimantAge, police_service).
% Exclusion 2.1.5: Age 80 or greater at time of hospitalization
is_claim_covered(_TimeOfHospitalization, ClaimantAge, _CauseOfHospitalization) :-
    ClaimantAge >= 80.

% Note: The policy insures worldwide, 24 hours a day (Section 3.1.1). This does not impose
% exclusions but rather coverage scope, so it's implicitly covered by
% `is_claim_covered` if no other exclusion applies.

% Note: Arbitration provisions (Section 3.2) and laws of New York (Section 3.3) and
% US Currency (Section 3.4) are procedural/governing and do not directly
% determine coverage of a claim itself based on the hospitalization event,
% but rather how disputes or payments are handled. They are not directly
% translated into coverage rules for the event of hospitalization.

% Note: Premium payment (Section 3.5) is assumed to be handled as per instructions.
% Policy term (Section 3.6) is handled in `policy_term_ended`.
