Instructions:
1.  You will be given a 'Target Program' written in Prolog, which includes comments explaining the predicates.
2.  You will also be given a 'Test Suite' containing a list of Prolog queries.
3.  The Program and the Test Suite were created independently and use different vocabularies for the same concepts (e.g., 'insurer/1' vs. 'company/1').
4.  Your task is to create a JSON mapping from the predicate names and arities in the 'Test Suite' to the equivalent ones in the 'Target Program'.
5.  Analyze the predicate names, arities, and the comments in the Target Program to determine the correct mapping.
6.  The JSON output should be a dictionary where keys are from the Test Suite and values are from the Target Program. Use the format "predicate_name/arity".
7.  If a test predicate has no equivalent in the program, map it to 'null'.
